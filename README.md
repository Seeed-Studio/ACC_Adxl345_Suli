![image](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/images/1/17/3-axis_Accelerometer_ADXL345.jpg)

This is a high resolution digital accelerometer providing you at max 3.9mg/LSB resolution and large Â±16g measurement range. It's base on an advanced 3-axis IC ADXL345. Have no worry to implement it into your free-fall detection project, cause it's robust enough to survive upto 10,000g shock. Meanwhile, it's agile enough to detect single and double taps.It's ideal for motion detection, Gesture detection as well as robotics.

**Note:**

This is a Suli-Compatible Library, You Should Download Suli for your platform, please refer to [https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Suli](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Suli "Suli")

If you can't find Suli for your platform, please contract us, If you can port it yourself and pull request to us, We'll be appreciated. 

***For Arduino:***

Just like you use the other Library, What's different is you should download Suli for Arduino First, remember that just put Suli for Arduino to your Arduino libraries folder.

***For non-Arduino Platform:***

For a non-Arduino platform, what you need is xxx.h and xxx.cpp(you can change it to xxx.c while your compiler can't support c++), the other files like xxx_Arduino.h and examples is for Arduino, you can just delete them.
